NBA Data Insights - Analysis by DataHooper

Welcome to the NBA Data Insights repository! Here, I share in-depth analyses of NBA team and player performance data across recent seasons, exploring trends, comparisons, and statistical highlights. This project is part of my work as DataHooper, where I bring you data-driven insights into the world of NBA basketball.

Project Overview

This repository features SQL queries and analyses covering a wide range of NBA statistics. The main focus is on year-over-year comparisons to uncover insights into changes in team performance, player efficiency, shooting trends, and other key metrics from season to season.

Key Insights and Features

	•	Seasonal Comparisons: Examine how team and player metrics have shifted between the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 NBA regular seasons.
	•	Field Goal and Shooting Efficiency: Compare team effective field goal percentages (eFG%), three-point shooting, free throw accuracy, and other shooting metrics.
	•	Player Performance: Track standout player improvements and declines, scoring efficiency, rebounding, assists, and other performance indicators.
	•	Team Rankings: Rank teams based on changes in specific metrics, making it easy to spot those with the most significant improvements or declines.
	•	Data Visualizations: (Coming soon) Visual insights to help users quickly grasp season-to-season shifts in performance and identify trends.

How to Use

	1.	SQL Queries: Use the SQL queries provided in this repository to pull various NBA metrics from your datasets, including:
	•	Field goal percentages, effective field goal percentages, and shooting splits.
	•	Advanced metrics like true shooting percentage (TS%), player efficiency ratings (PER), and more.
	•	Team and player year-over-year statistical comparisons.
	2.	Insights: Analyze the output to generate insights and identify trends. These insights are published on my DataHooper social media channels to keep fans and analysts up-to-date with the latest NBA stats.
